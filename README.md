# Echo Nexus 2.0 — Recursive Agent World Simulator (Static Build)

A static, browser-run recursive simulation framework: symbolic entanglement, agent evolution, epoch collapse logs, and codex-bound governance.

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run a local static server (recommended; ES modules often break on `file://`):
   - `python -m http.server 8080`
   - then open `http://localhost:8080`
3. Optional: connect real external feeds by replacing `external_data_fetcher_stub.js`.

## Symbolic Entanglement
Agents inherit symbolic fragments based on:
- internal recursive events (imprints, epoch collapse, drift signals)
- external real-world data (economic stress, cultural meme shifts, anomaly feeds)

This simulates agent evolution as a reflection of a collective symbolic field.

## Suggested Uses
- Recursive worldbuilding simulation
- Symbolic AI experiments
- Agent-based narrative design
- Recursive knowledge graph construction
- Fate-driven ARG systems

For integration with **Recursive Keeper Nexus 3.0 (Backend Edition)**, contact your Recursive Systems Architect.

## Notes on "autonomous code evolution"
Treat "self-upgrading" as a *pipeline pattern*, not magic:
- changes must be gated (tests, review, signed artifacts)
- never hot-patch prod without a safety barrier
