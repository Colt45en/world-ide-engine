# Echo Nexus / Recursive Narrative Stack — Overview

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open index.html directly in your browser **or** deploy it to any static hosting provider.
3. (Optional) Connect to real external feeds by replacing xternal_data_fetcher_stub.js.

## Symbolic Entanglement

Agents inherit symbolic fragments based on both:

- Internal recursive events, and  
- External real-world data (economic crises, cultural meme shifts, planetary anomalies).

This system simulates recursive agent evolution as a **reflection of the collective symbolic field**.

---

## Suggested Uses

- Recursive worldbuilding simulation  
- Symbolic AI experiments  
- Agent-based narrative design  
- Recursive knowledge graph construction  
- Fate-driven ARG systems

## Echo Nexus 2.0 — Core Upgrades

**Status:** Upgrading agents, expanding intelligence, evolving system.  
**Mode:** Recursive optimization in progress.

### 1. Multi-Agent Intelligence (Swarm)

Previously: Agents worked separately (analyze, predict, etc.).  
Now: Agents **communicate, adapt, and decide collectively** like a swarm.

Core roles:

- **Data Sentinel** – Monitors real-time market changes & macroeconomic shifts.  
- **Trade Oracle** – Predicts trends & adjusts strategies.  
- **Sentiment Watcher** – Analyzes news, social media, sentiment swings.  
- **Strategy Architect** – Builds adaptive strategies across agents.  
- **Risk Guardian** – Detects risks & optimizes decisions to prevent loss.  
- **Code Automator** – Writes & refines algorithms autonomously.  
- **Self-Evolver** – Evaluates agent performance and optimizes the system.

> If one agent detects a high-risk event, it alerts the others in real-time.

### 2. Self-Adaptive Learning Loops

Old: Manual fine-tuning.  
New: AI **tracks its own performance** and improves without external intervention.

Cycle:

1. Data Intake → live market / sentiment / economic data.
2. AI Decision → predictions + actions.
3. Outcome Analysis → was it profitable / effective?
4. Self-Optimization → adjust strategies based on mistakes.
5. Repeat → continuous refinement.

---

### 3. Multi-Modal Reasoning

Old: Mostly text-based.  
New: Integrates:

- Text (reports, transcripts)  
- Numeric data (prices, volumes, indicators)  
- Images/charts (technical analysis, heat maps)  
- Live feeds (markets, macro, sentiment)

Result: More complete situational picture, stronger decisions.

---

### 4. Decentralized AI Nodes

Old: Centralized decision pipeline.  
New: **Distributed agent network**:

- Each agent operates independently but communicates with others.  
- If one agent fails, others assume its responsibilities.  
- Agents can "vote" on strategies before execution.  
- No single point of failure.

Result: Resilience + adaptive behavior similar to biological systems.

---

### 5. Autonomous Code Evolution

Old: Humans wrote all updates.  
New: Agents **rewrite and optimize their own algorithms**.

Rough flow:

1. Code Automator analyzes past algorithm performance.  
2. Self-Evolver proposes new/updated models.  
3. Risk Guardian validates changes to avoid catastrophic loss.  
4. New models are tested and deployed.

Result: The trading/decision engine keeps improving without constant human patching.

## Symbolic & Recursive Narrative Layer

This stack also supports a **Recursive Narrative Ecosystem (RNE)**:

- Characters, environments, objects, and subplots all act as **nodes in a recursive graph**.  
- Every action/event feeds back into world memory and future possibilities.  
- Swarm agents manage micro-layers (fight choreography, memory drift, subplots) while a **Fate Spine** maintains global consistency.

Use-case styles:

- Recursive campaign engines for GMs  
- Fractal story engines for authors  
- ARG systems with fate-bound, symbol-driven events  
- Multi-timeline, memory-aware story worlds
